Build a global model using federated learning with multiple servers 
and clients all of which are docker containers.
The goal is to train a model on EMNIST byClass which will be made available 
to clients in fixed random permutations of the dataset during client init 
from the dataset which will be present in a shared volume.
Implement various federated learning features such as:
1. Using clustering methods for generating the global model to avoid adversial attacks.
2. Adding a small amount of noise for each local model trained on a client in order to preserve data privacy before sending it to the server.
3. Testing and ensuring that the training process is resistant to model poisoning.
4. Encapsulating this whole process into a single docker compose file in order to scale up/down clients and servers.
